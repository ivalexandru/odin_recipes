<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is the best lasagna we have ever had, including restaurants! Great with a salad and garlic bread.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Â½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>In a large pot cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until al dente. Rinse with cool water. Drain.</li>
    <li>In large sauce pan cook ground beef. Drain excess grease. Combine tomato sauces and tomato paste with ground beef and simmer until bubbly. Add garlic salt and Italian seasoning and reduce heat to low simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>To assemble, in the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking dish spread a thin layer of sauce. Next, add a layer of noodles, ricotta cheese, sauce/ground beef mixture, and then grated mozzarella cheese. Repeat until baking dish is filled. Garnish top with additional shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
